1N4148WT  65x,    https://ecom.cz/eshop/detail/79882
these were cheapest i could find
like 5 dollars + shipping

rasberry pi pico 2,         https://www.alza.cz/raspberry-pi-pico-2-d12496353.htm
less then 10 dollars + shipping (is about 2 dollars or free if i come pick it up at their stores)

forgot to send it but i will need some material to solder woth and optionally some flux

all will be 80 dollars + shipping + material and flux so i fit perfectly to the 100 dollars range
 also i tried to find local stores beacose in the ones in USA the shipping costed more than the actual product
