HI heres everything u need to know to find anything.
So in FILES there are files all KiCad and 3D.

Each category has its own README.md where u can find the pictures and info.

In COST of everything u can find the .bom file and all the things il need in the README.md

PICTURES(the file) arent important since i put all of the pictures in each category.

also i added better kicad file inside the kicad folder it uses a better and custom pi pico library

NOTE FOR REVIEWERS:
Please tell me all the mistakes i made id love to make it perfect before getting the parts shipped ty😊
